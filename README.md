# Datasheet: Dutch Education System Effectiveness
This repository contains the data sources as they were used for creating the main merged dataset and corresponding knowledge graph.

The datasheet describing the data and all mutations can be found [here](Datasheet-eduviz.pdf)

# EduViz dashboard
This data and all visualizations can be interactively explored over at https://eduviz.nl

The website uses the same code displayed in this repository at its back-end to load, preprocess and visualize the data.
